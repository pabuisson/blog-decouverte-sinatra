Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh
Why don't I try to forget

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you, it had to be you
I've wandered around, finally found somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you

Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or, try to be boss
But, they wouldn't do

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you

'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still now
And it had to be you, it just had to be you
It had to be you
