Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes, each one she passes goes

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle that
When she passes, each one she passes goes

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her, "I love you?"
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes, I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graa
ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balano a caminho do mar

Moa do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balanado mais que um poema
a coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

But I watch her so sadly
Porque tudo to triste
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never seem me
Por causa do amor
